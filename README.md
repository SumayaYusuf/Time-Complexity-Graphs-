# Time-Complexity-Graphs-
This Python script benchmarks the performance of various sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Shell Sort, across different list conditions (random, ordered, partially ordered, and reversed). It generates random lists of varying sizes, sorts them using each algorithm under different conditions, and measures the execution time to analyze efficiency. The script utilizes the `matplotlib` library to plot these times against list sizes, providing a visual comparison of algorithm performance. This benchmarking tool is designed for those interested in algorithm optimization and computational complexity, offering insights into how different sorting techniques scale with data size and order.

Testing: 
Random Lists: Data in no particular order.
Ordered Lists: Data pre-sorted in ascending order.
Partially Ordered Lists: The first half is sorted, and the second half is random.
Reversed Lists: Data sorted in descending order.

Log Testing:

Add logging functionality to capture key events and performance metrics during the execution.
Insert test numbers or identifiers for each sorting and list condition scenario to track and analyze specific tests.
